Heya, new tenant. Though I guess you get less and less new each day, huh?

I hope you're still enjoying your stay here. I, er, noticed you got the garage powered back on.
We might have to talk about that uptick in your electricity use someday.
And we might need to have a conversation about that discount I gave ya...
...y'know, the one I gave ya assuming you wouldn't be able to use your own garage.
Since, well, you can use it now.

Lucky for you, I'm still super busy finding a new intern. Every good landlord has one, I hear.
So maybe we could have those conversations *later*. Like *much* later.
I would just, uh, need a few things from you in the meantime.
For one, there's a few...um, *distractions* on your property. Well, my property.
*Our* property, we'll say.
Every good landlord is *very* concerned with the impressions given by their properties.
*Our* properties.
And, um, I'm sure you noticed...but your backyard's a bit of a mess.

I know, I know, you're not the one that *made* the mess.
It was that dang engineer that lived here before.
But. Um. Since it's *your* backyard now...well, *someone's* got to clean it up.
So, like I said, if you could just do the following things for me...for *us*...
...then I guess we wouldn't have to talk about that electricity bill.
Or that garage discount that doesn't really make sense any more.

Here's what I had in mind:
- [ ] Clean out the sandbox
- [ ] Freshen up the flowerbeds
- [ ] Do something about that huge pile of wood

The sandbox seems like the top priority. The *smell* coming from that thing is...yikes.
I'd take care of the flowers next. Seems like an easy enough thing to take care of.
As far as the wood goes...there'a *lot* of it. And this is a no-burn zone.
I'm sure you'll figure something out, though.

Signed,

The Landlord
