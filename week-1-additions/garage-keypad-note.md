Hey there, new tenant.

So, as you can see, your new garage is without electricity. I'm real sorry about that.
The previous tenant was a bit...eccentric. She was an engineer of some sort, I think.
I understand that the garage is where she did all her work,
and apparently the work she did was a little...power-intensive.
We got into a few tiffs about it. I'm a nice guy, and I cover utilities, see.
People sometimes like to mention that when they review the place. Just saying.

She installed this crazy power shut-off mechanism, to keep the power drain to a minimum
whenever she wasn't working.
Problem is, neither me nor the intern can get the dang thing to power back *on*.

You'll need a 4-digit code of some sort, clearly, but I'm afraid she didn't tell it to me before she moved out.
Can't get a hold of her to get the code either. Not sure what happened to the lady.

In any case, I had the intern try to "hack" the code.
If it helps, she's sure it *doesn't* start with a 0.
Said she tried everything from 0000 to 0999.
But then she said, "You don't even pay me for this" and quit.
I, ah, need to find a new intern.

However, before she quit she did find this weird...thingy...next to the keypad.
Two of the thingies, actually.
I'm clipping them onto this note. You probably already saw them.
Like I said, the prior tenant was an engineer of some sort, and I've got a hunch that those...
thingies...are the the key to finding the code.
You just have to, uh, figure out how it works.
Sorry about that.

If it helps, I'll deduct the garage from your rent.
Since, well, you can't really use it.
Sorry about that.

Signed,

The Landlord
