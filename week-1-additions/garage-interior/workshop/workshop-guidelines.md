HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR WORKSHOP SPACE:

1. Note the garage's security: while other residents of `term-world` can scope out your `house` and whatever cool things you fill it with, the intense locking mechanisms on your `garage` mean that everything contained within is *for your eyes only*, with one important caveat: given that weekly engineering repositories will be stored here, the instructor *will* have access for grading/evaluation purposes.

2. Expect *about* one engineering (assignment) repository to work on within your workshop per week.

3. In order to work on these repositories, you'll first need to accept them and then copy the repository link. To accept assignments, you'll need to click instructor-provided links (these links will be provided via Discord, so it's important to keep up on your messages). Once you've accepted the assignment you'll need to navigate to the green `Code` button and copy the URL that appears while `SSH` is selected.

4. With this URL in hand, navigate to the `workshop` directory within the terminal window. Once inside the `workshop directory`, use the command `git clone THE_URL_YOU_COPIED_IN_STEP_3`. You'll then need to provide the password associated with your SSH key (remember, no text will appear onscreen while typing your password in--a security feature, not a bug).

5. While working in your newly cloned engineering repositories, be sure to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes regularly! This ensures that the changes you make to the repositories are saved back to GitHub. Use these commands in succession:
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "DESCRIPTIVE COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"` (keep the quote marks)
- `git push`
